When it comes to learning, there’s no substitute for getting your hands dirty! Now that you understand the basic Kubernetes concepts, it’s time to get some hands-on time and see them in action. 

These hands-on, interactive learning modules are a great learning resource and will help you directly explore key concepts you’ve read and heard about by trying things out interactively. Best of all, there’s no complicated setup required as everything is taken care of and all you need to do is follow the instructions to see things in action!

By the end of this module, you’ll have firsthand experience with: 
* Launching a single node cluster
* Running your first container on Kubernetes
* Deploying a container using YAML
* Managing Kubernetes secrets
* Deploying a service into Kubernetes
* Defining ingress routing
* Checking on container health
* Using the Helm Package Manager
* Setting up networking between Kubernetes components

# Explore Kubernetes with Katacoda
*Participate in these hands-on, interactive learning modules through Katacoda to run your first container on Kubernetes. The modules explore basic concepts like YAML definitions, networking, secrets, and application deployments from source code.*

## Launch a single-node Kubernetes cluster
*Minikube is a tool that makes it easy to run Kubernetes locally. The tool runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster inside a VM on your laptop, enabling you to start developing with Kubernetes right away.*

## Start containers using Kubectl
*In this scenario, you’ll learn how to use Kubectl to create Deployments and Replication Controllers and expose them via Services without writing YAML definitions. This allows you to quickly launch containers onto the cluster.*

## Deploy containers using YAML
*This module builds on the previous one to help you launch your Deployments and Replication Controllers. It teaches you how YAML definitions define Kubernetes Objects and how to schedule those objects for deployment.*

## Use Kubernetes to manage secrets
*Learn how to manage secrets using Kubernetes. Kubernetes allows you to create secrets that are mounted to a pod, which means they can only be managed via an infrastructure team in  a secure way—instead of using passwords stored within artifacts.*

## Get an introduction to networking
*Kubernetes’s advanced networking capabilities allow pods and Services to communicate inside and externally to the cluster’s network. You’ll learn about a variety of Kubernetes services, including Cluster IP, Target Ports, Load Balancer, and more.*

## Deploy a service into Kubernetes
*In this tutorial, you’ll learn about the basics of deploying a  service into Kubernetes from source code to a running Kubernetes cluster.*

## Create Ingress Routing
*Learn how to define host and path based Ingress routing.*

## Liveness and Readiness Healthchecks
*Learn how to ensure containers health using Liveness and Readiness probes*
https://www.katacoda.com/courses/kubernetes/liveness-readiness-healthchecks
##Helm Package Manager
*Use Helm Package Manager for Kubernetes to deploy Redis.*

## First Steps To Becoming Certified Kubernetes Application Developer
*Learn the foundations of Kubernetes in one short scenario.*
