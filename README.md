Kubernetes is taking the app development world by storm. By 2022, more than 75% of global organizations will be running containerized applications in production^. And Kubernetes continues to grow, as evidenced by more than 1.1 million contributions made to the Kubernetes project by over 2000 contributing companies+. 

Kubernetes is shaping the future of app development and management—and we wants to help you get started with it today. 

This learning path is meant for anyone interested in learning more about Kubernetes. In just 50 days, you’ll understand the basics of Kubernetes and get hands-on experience with its various components, capabilities, and solutions, including Azure Kubernetes Service. Go from zero to hero with Kubernetes to set your company up for future app development success.

Kubernetes learning path is designed to be a curated learning path for those interested in Kubernetes in general. The learning path may also include Azure Kubernetes Service and related resources where exposure to a managed Kubernetes service faciliates learning about Kubernetes. 

The intent is to the share good content we have identified so far to inspire the community to contribute additional learning resources & capture the best content related to Kubernetes in one place to make them available to the community as a curated, well maintained resource on GitHub. Additionally, we will use it to create a variety of more customized resources to drive awareness and education about Kubernetes. 

For example, it will serve as the basis for future updates to the [Kubernetes Learning Path "Zero to Hero"](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/kubernetes-learning-path/). 

And of course other potential uses that are yet to be conceived.

# Guidelines
New content submitted for inclusion to the Kubernetes learning path must meet the following guidelines:
* Resource is relevant to Kubernetes
* Resource is publicly available
* Resource content is current and up to date
* Resource is published by an authorative source

# Notes
As this is a curated learning path, the owners of this list may reject a resource that is too narrowly focused or where other similar content already exists in the learning path.
